The basic idea of the application is meal planning and caloric intake monitoring. Recipes are available by communicating with the API.
Users of the application have the ability to search for recipes and add them as their meals for the selected date. 
In addition to the selected meal, they also choose the time when they plan that meal in order to receive notifications at the selected time and be able to 
take a picture of their meal. For the selected daily menu, the caloric intake is calculated and a diagram which includes the daily calorie intake in the previous period is drawn.
Also, two different layouts are available: for tablet and mobile phone.
